**Description**: Explore customer churn in Tableau rates using banking customer data.

**Tool**: Tableau

**Project Type**: Data Analysis, Data Visualization

## Summary

#### Goal

It's a well-known fact that it's a lot more expensive to attract new customers, compared to retaining the current ones. That's why companies are obsessed with keeping their customers, and that's why this project aims at analyzing customer churn rates using banking customer data.

#### Process

A crucial step of this project is data understanding and accurate calculation of customer churn rates. First, individual visualizations in worksheets are built, which then are combined into three dashboards, which then are combined into one compelling Tableau story.

#### Insights

Below segments churn at much higher rates compared to others

1. Customers aged between 45 - 60: Customers between 45-60 churn at much higher rates compared to other age groups

2. Customers who have complained at least once: ​Customers who have complained at least once have pretty much all left the bank. On the other hand, customers who have not complained have pretty much all stayed with the bank. In fact, all active customers who have not complained are all still using the bank's products and services.


3. German customers: German customers' churn rates are twice as high as that of French and Spanish customers 

4. Customers with 3 or more products: Customers with 3 or more products leave the bank at a significantly higher rate than customers with fewer products
