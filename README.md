# customer-churn-analysis

## Summary

#### Goal

It's a well-known fact that it's a lot more expensive to attract new customers, compared to retaining the current ones. That's why companies are obsessed with keeping their customers, and that's why this project aims at analyzing customer churn rates using banking customer data.

#### Process

A crucial step of this project is data understanding and accurate calculation of customer churn rates. First, individual visualizations in worksheets are built, which then are combined into three dashboards, which then are combined into one compelling Tableau story.

#### Insights

Below segments churn at much higher rates compared to others

1. Customers aged between 45 - 60

2. Customers who have complained at least once

3. German customers

4. Customers with 3 or more products
